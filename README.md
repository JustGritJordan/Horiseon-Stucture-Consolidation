# <horiseon-structure-consolidation>

## Description

once involed in the project the motivation is to influence the product in a why that leaves it better than it was before beginning the project.

i built this project contribute to horiseons efforts in making their website for accessible for those who need the additional help.

through refactoring, i have now edited the code html and css to be more readable and improved navigation of the differenct sections of the webpage. this allows for a faster means of adding features or making adjustments for whomever developer should work behind me. moreover, alt attributes have now been included to aid the visually impaired and to improve the overall user experience to increase online traffic.

i learned how different visual a coding structure is without semantic elements. i learned that as code becomes longer and more complex that the uses of frequent comments is imparative, not only to remember what i have but to also tell a developer behind me what i have done. another point that i observerd is how much editing his possible to do without actually changing the functionality of the website. in contrast i have also learned how little it takes to alter a webpage completley going the opposite direction of what your trying to accomplish.
